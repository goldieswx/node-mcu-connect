node-mcu-connect 
================

node.js helper functions to interface with embedded ethernet devices through UDP.
Currently only arduino is supported, but a raspberry GPIO client an a dual way MSP430 spi interface communication protocol is in experimentation.

This project is open source, licensed under GPLv3 terms (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/).

As you will probably notice, the code base is still experimental.

I am uploading the project through Github, so you might have a few issues while setting this up. I'll remove the message once a stable environment is in place.
